# My_Python_Problems_and_Solutions
This is a repository of all the python problems I have completed from the start of learning Python to now.

Some problems are from hackerrank and some problems are from the PDF by Charles Severance which can be found at this link https://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf.

Other files are projects or problems that I did with my own time and interest
